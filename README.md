# DijkstraRuby
Ruby implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm of shortest path, with a graphic terminal created with GTK3

## How to use
The application can be run by running the run.rb script - this by default will run the GTK3 (graphic) version of the application.
Alternatively, the application can be run through the terminal - in order to do this, the GTK3 part of the code needs to be commented and the part of the code below it uncommented.
